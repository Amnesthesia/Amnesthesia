## Work Experience

#### Software Developer *2015 - Present*

I currently work at a pure information security company, meaning that every aspect of what we do, relates to information security. I first started at the Network Analysis department, where I developed a system for managing Intrusion Detection System signatures, and later moved to the development department. Here, my role was as a front-end developer on an agile team, primarily developing user interfaces for the flagship SIEM platform, and other internal systems, scripts for integrating customers with our platform, and an extensive Python framework for integrating with the platform via API.

#### Web Developer *2009 - 2012*

At a small company in Sweden, whose primary product is subscription-based sign making software, I started working immediately after high school. Here I took on a full-stack role: Designed, developed and administered the company's international website and licensing system, as well as an identical but separate setup on another server in Shenzhen for the company's asian market.
