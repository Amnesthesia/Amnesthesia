## About

---

Originally from Sweden, I’m a coding enthusiast with a broad set of technical skills, currently residing in Norway.

I began coding at age 15, when I started studying C/++ in high school, and continued with PHP in the later years, followed by Ruby, Python, and Javascript.

Since completing my degree in Information Security, I’ve worked on the development team of one of the most prominent information security companies in Europe .

As a developer with a background in InfoSec, I never consider security an afterthought, but an integral part of software development.
