I'm not entirely sure why that popped into my head, but it had me asking \"Wait, why can't we have Achievements in real life? Oh, right, it's cause we don't have minimaps in real life\". I was holding my new iPhone at the time, and this was when iPhones were a fairly new phenomenon. *\"Wait, we <strong>do</strong> have minimaps!\"*. There just wasn't any reason for why we couldn't have Achievements in real life, I thought.</p>\n<p>I thought this would be a great project to work on - to bring the concept of <em>achievements</em> to life, as a sort of augmented reality game, and began thinking about how to structure this.</p>\n<p>I've seen many attempts being done on this ever since, often focusing around very specific industries (e.g fitness), or niches like habit building, but none that really encompass <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, this is probably the only project I've worked on where coming up with the <em>name</em> and logo has been more difficult than coming up with the implementation, but I've codenamed it <em>Eventyr</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The core idea behind Eventyr is that life is only the memories you make, and the warm relations you create with other people - so lets help people do more of that!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wanted to do this by combining people's almost infinite appetite for distractions, and addictions to often seemingly pointless games that in no way affects their lives but give a temporary feeling of achievement, I want to make <strong>life</strong> into a game worth playing, where the objectives are the real objectives of life: Collecting good memories, and creating warm relations. Whilst you may think you're just collecting points in an app, you're really just playing life as an augmented reality game.</p>\n<p>By taking on the role of a child where everything is new, or as a tourist in your own city - going out and discovering places, seeing things and meeting people, you would unlock Achievements. If you make new friends along the way, that gives you higher points. The more times you complete achievements with the same people, the less amount of bonus points you get, but always more than doing it alone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problems\"><a href=\"#problems\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Problems</h2>\n<p>For an app like this to be successful, it would need to have an active community, and already from the launch it would need to have a vast repository of existing Achievements people could complete. Nobody would want to download an application like this with no content (or worse: half-assed content).</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this could be precisely the kind of app that NGO tourist organizations would like to sponsor to market their own points of interests and get their message out for tourists, for example DNT in Norway, or STF in Sweden.</p>\n<p>The roadmap would look something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Launch a prototype of Eventyr</li>\n<li>Create a website where administrators and organizations can manage their Achievements in bulk</li>\n<li>Launch in one area at the time</li>\n<li>???????</li>\n<li>Profit</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see, there's quite a big hole in this plan: Namely, it depends <em>entirely</em> on volunteer organizations to do most of the marketing for the app, and if they're not interested, the whole thing falls together. Another one is the opposite end of the scale: What <em>if</em>, hypothetically, marketing goes extremely well and a lot of users join at once, and we need to scale immediately. I am just one person, with limited finances and time. This means that launching this app would be difficult if it doesn't go well, and difficult if it goes really well.</p>\n<p>This is why I've decided to open-source the whole platform, and perhaps it could become one of the first open source social networking / geo-adventure apps where both the server and the client are entirely community supported.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-would-it-work\"><a href=\"#how-would-it-work\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How would it work?</h2>\n<p>Let's say you travel to Paris, and go up the Eiffel Tower.

This is why I've implemented this so that the user's location is <em>never</em> stored on the server. </p>\n<p>Instead, to find new Achievements, or unlock an Achievement, the user makes a request to the server with approximate coordinates, and receives a response - but the coordinates are never stored server-side.</p>\n<p>Even when a user wants to find other users to cooperate with, the server never knows where other users are, but it does know what Achievements have been <em>suggested</em> to that user based on his location (and so, it knows an approximate location of a radius of 10km). </p>\n<p>Users to cooperate with can be suggested based on amount of matching <em>suggested</em> Achievements only, and not based on actual distance between users. It's assumed that if users have a lot of overlapping suggested Achievements (and these are suggested based on radius from user location), then they must be fairly close to one another.</p>\n<p>No user data really needs to be kept by the server other than that, and progress on Achievements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation\"><a href=\"#implementation\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Implementation</h2>\n<p>Every user has two scores: Points, and <strong>Private</strong> Points. Private Points are granted for unverifiable achievements, or private achievements. For example, Achievements to perform an action (lets say, Achievement: Perform 20 sit-ups) can't be verified with coordinates, and we have no way of verifying a photo even if a photo is used for verification. Therefore, this kind of Achievement only grants Private points, and they are more for fun than for competition.</p>\n<p>Normal Points can get you on top lists, whereas Private Points cannot. However, if an Achievement that has been completed undergoes a review and published to all users, then of course everyone who has completed this Achievement will have their personal points reduced and their Points increased accordingly.</p>\n<p>Your phone automatically keeps a local database of your Unlocked, Suggested, and Bookmarked Achievements. Whenever you have an internet connection, and this data hasn't been updated for a while, the phone sends its current coordinates to the server (and these are <strong><em>never</em></strong> stored on the server! Privacy is an important aspect built-in to this) and receives a list of nearby Achievements.</p>\n<p>The app can then clear out the list of Suggested Achievements and update it with new Suggested Achievements. A Bookmarked Achievement is an Achievement the user has manually chosen to mark as <em>suggested</em>, whereas Suggested Achievements happen automatically as you move around in the world. This is how Achievements are unlocked as well. The app only checks the list of Suggested Achievements occasionally, running as a service in the background, and when it finds the user to be moving closer and closer to one of the Tracked Achievements, it increases the frequency to check.</p>\n<p>When a user is within bounds of unlocking the Location Achievement, it becomes unlocked and the user is awarded points according to a simple formula. However, if the user doesn't have wifi or 3G connection, as (s)he may be traveling, the current timestamp, coordinates, Achievement, and so on is added in its local encrypted database queue. When a connection is available, all updates made to the users account are sent to the server in order, with their timestamps and signed with a HMAC based on the users secret token.</p>\n<p>Because we never need to store coordinates of users, we can find other users who are nearby, without knowing where they are -- we just know that the two users have many Suggested Achievements in common.</p>\n<h3 id=\"point-calculation\"><a href=\"#point-calculation\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Point calculation</h3>\n<p>Points are granted based on the Category an Achievement belongs to.

Let's say you're sitting at a cafÃ© in Paris, before you're going to the Eiffel Tower. You wish to earn some extra points (reflected in real life by connecting with new people), so you opt in for Coop. Mode. You can either \"Look for Group\" or invite somebody else who has similar Tracked Achievement's as you.  </p>\n<p>Whenever you unlock an Achievement/Objectives, when the points are calculated and verified officially on the server, it checks if you were linked with somebody else for that Achievement.

For every time you unlock with the same person, the bonus decreases. It decreases less and less all the time, so you will always get <em>some</em> extra and never reach 0 bonus, but only the first 10-20 times will be a significant bonus. This is to encourage people to coop with <em>new</em> people and not the same friend over and over again. You can still do that, but it's not going to be that beneficial for your score.</p>\n<p>Also, if you're cooperating with more than 1 person, you will receive the highest coop bonus you could be granted. Let's say you're cooperating with 2 others, and one of them you've never cooperated with, whilst the other you've cooperated with 5 times. You will still get the 85% bonus because you always receive the highest coop-bonus.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cooperating-with-friends\"><a href=\"#cooperating-with-friends\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cooperating with Friends</h3>\n<p>Inspired by a quest given to an Estonian exchange student here last year, who had been given a list of Achievements to unlock before he returned home, it's also possible to create a list of Achievements and share it with other users (or on social media).</p>\n<p>Users can then Bookmark this list, and if they complete Achievements within a certain time span of each other, they get a small cooperation bonus.

An Achievement is really just a container for one or more objectives, and an objective may also be part of many acheivements: Objectives are the things that actually have to get done.</p>\n<p>Right now, these are the different Achievement <strong>types</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location</strong>: Visit a Location to unlock</li>\n<li><strong>Discovery</strong>: Visit multiple Locations to unlock</li>\n<li><strong>Route</strong>: Visit multiple Locations <strong>IN ORDER</strong> to unlock</li>\n<li><strong>Action</strong>: Perform an action (needs manual unlocking, and grants no <strong>public</strong> points)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>... additions to the ones above are when a time limit is added (i.e must be completed before [date]) or recurring (i.e must be done 5 times in X days)</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Highest Peaks</strong> <br/> Find the highest mountain of each continent: <br /> * Go to Mt.

Everest</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By completing <strong>Basecamp</strong>, you would have completed 1 out of 8 objectives in <strong>The Highest Peaks</strong> as well. This way, completing several Achievements may lead to completing one much bigger Achievement, where the Achievements shared objectives.</p>\n<p>An Achievement is just a container for Objectives. Objectives are unlocked, and when all Objectives for an Achievement is unlocked, they grant points and the Achievement becomes unlocked.</p>\n<p>When an Achievement is unlocked, the user can choose to take a photo.

If the objective is to visit a location once, that one time will be 100% towards its completion and the progress will be set to complete.</p>\n<p>And, of course, an Achievement has a <em>Category</em>, <em>Difficulty</em>, and <em>Type</em>; these are important for the points calculation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"ideas-for-supporting-future-development-and-maintenance-costs\"><a href=\"#ideas-for-supporting-future-development-and-maintenance-costs\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Ideas for supporting future development and maintenance costs</h3>\n<p>I don't want to monetize this but it may turn out that I'll have to, to be able to sustain the costs. It's important to me that we then keep in mind that life is for everyone, and you shouldn't have to pay for this. One idea is to let companies purchase visibility on the site in a <em>non-intrusive</em> way. For example, imagine you have an Achievement for Sky-Diving. We could then pull out nearby organizations that could help you complete this Achievement, which would be more of a help to users than it would be a burden with ads.</p>\n<p>Another idea is to release \"off-shoot\" apps as Enterprise-apps, e.g H&#x26;M could buy a corporate version of the app used only for employees, and this app would be branded accordingly, but only display Achievements by the organization.</p>","id":"d9178477-a12e-5546-b1e1-7a9c14abb683","fields":{"slug":"aeventyr"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-09-14","title":"Ã†ventyr","category":"Projects","icon":"/projects/eventyr/icon.png","tags":["Technology","Coding"],"banner":"/projects/eventyr/banner.jpg"},"timeToRead":12},{"excerpt":" I'm an avid runner, and I run on most days of the week - but recently I've realized that as I go further and further, my knee begins to ache around the 11-12km mark.

After doing some research of my own, I came to realize that as my job is a sedentary one, and for most of my life I've been spending a big part of the day sitting down, this may have lead to my quadriceps being rather weak, and leading to bad running form.</p>\n<p>Although running form may be decent for the first part of a long run, as my muscles get tired, they weaken and my legs begin to get angled inward, putting a lot of weight on my knees. Practicing good form is of course a virtal part of running, but I began to wonder if perhaps weakness in my thighs and hips were making that more difficult than it needs to be.</p>\n<p>A couple of years ago I came across the weight lifting program I've enjoyed the most so far: Greyskull LP. It allowed me to see quick results, and focus on compound lifts. That said, I've also tried other popular exercise regiments like <em>AllPro</em>, but Greyskull were the one I liked the most. Everytime I've gotten started with Greyskull LP again, I've re-used my aging Excel / GDocs spreadsheet (often printed out).</p>\n<p>When I started looking for an app to replace the spreadsheet, I found only one made specifically for GSLP, and I found it to be more lacking in both design and functionality than my spreadsheet was. I realized I could probably make an app that just re-implements my spreadsheet but with a nicer design, and add whatever features I felt couldn't be accomplished by the spreadsheet â€” so I set out to create an app just like that.</p>\n<p>Having originally hoped it would take less than a weekend of work, I ended up in a rabbit hole of both restructuring code (from originally using Apollo with link-state-local, to using a redux style architecture with the new <code class=\"language-text\">React.Context</code> API).</p>\n<p>Now the app is more or less finished and although it was originally intended only for me, I thought perhaps other people would like the same app, and decided to publish it on the app store: This is the first app I've actually finished and published!</p>","id":"54024f8a-1b6f-510e-8508-532980c14459","fields":{"slug":"gslp"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-02-02","title":"GSLP","category":"Projects","icon":"/projects/gslp/icon.png","tags":["Technology","Coding"],"banner":"/assets/gslp.jpg"},"timeToRead":2}],"categoryName":"Projects"}}
